### Previous Coding Experience
- The first time I was introduced to coding was in a GA summer camp. We learned the basics to setting up video games on computers. At the end of the camp we tested our video games to see which ones actually worked. My most recent experience with coding was this summer in a math course I toke. I learned to use the program "Wolfram" to code mathematical expressions. This allowed me to visualize graphs and solve intricate equations.
### Reasons For Taking The Class
- The reason I am taking this class is because of my large interest in science and technology. In the future, I want to pursue science and engineering and I am eager to begin coding since coding is a foundation for technology.
### Other Interests
- Along with computer science, I am also interested in math and spanish. Outside of academic, I competitively play golf and love to build small projects.
### Goals
- My goal for this course is to walk out understanding the basics of coding. I want to be able to code since it will help me when I pursue technology in the future. I also look forward to designing games this year.
### Worries
- The only worry I have is I do not have enough coding experience.
